* Improvements

- Make the setting per user so that every admin can decide whether they would like to get such email or not

- Avoid hardcoding the wpengine fake user and have a more flexible way (e.g. list of emails in a separate file) to avoid these hosting accounts

- Translating the strings

- Switching the email text to html and providing a direct link to the post page & the comment text (see exemples here: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_mail/ )
